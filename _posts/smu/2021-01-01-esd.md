<b>Project Name:</b> Online Music Store

<b>Role:</b> Team Leader & Lead Developer

Due to the COVID pandemic, the music industry has been hit particularly hard, where many artists and physical stores selling instruments have been losing money.
To tackle this problem, this online music store will serve as a platform to sell instruments from various stores and physical albums ranging from different genres as well as merchandise from artists.

Technical wise, we utilized microservice architecture to ensure that our solution is as loosely-coupled as possible to allow for easier maintenance. The Stripe API is also used to better facilitate payments on the website.
