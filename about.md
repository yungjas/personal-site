Hi! My name is Jasmine, and I am a student living in Singapore. I am currently an undergraduate @ SMU majoring in Information Systems. I have always been a tech geek, and my curiosity about technology led me to enroll in Information Technology in Singapore Polytechnic, where I first began my software development journey. After graduating from Singapore Polytechnic, I decided to deepen my technological knowledge and achieve one of my academic dreams, which is to enroll in university.

Other than coding or doing assignments, I like to listen to music. I am currently learning about music production, and I hope I will be able to start producing my own music very soon.
