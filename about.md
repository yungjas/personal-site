Hi! My name is Jasmine, and I am a student living in Singapore. I am currently an undergraduate at SMU majoring in Information Systems. I have always been a tech geek, and my curiosity about technology led me to enroll in Information Technology in Singapore Polytechnic, where I first began my software development journey. After graduating from Singapore Polytechnic, I decided to deepen my technological knowledge and achieve one of my academic dreams, which is to enroll in university.

Embarking on school projects has allowed me to step out of my comfort zone and take on leadership roles as well as learn various technical skillsets. The following are programming languages / other technical skillsets I am proficient with:
<ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>SQL</li>
    <li>Frontend Web Development - HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
    <li>Web Development Frameworks - Python Flask, .NET Core</li>
    <li>System support using AWS Educate</li>
</ul>

Other than coding or doing assignments, I like to listen to music. I don't have a specific genre I'd stick to, as long as I like the song it's going into my playlist. Also, I may listen to different types of music depending on my mood that day. Some of my favourite artists include SHINee, Dreamcatcher, EXID and SCARLXRD.
